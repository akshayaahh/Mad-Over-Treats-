    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-mad-blue mb-6">About Us</h1>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Mad for Treats began with a simple mission: to offer dogs treats that are as wholesome as they are delicious. What started as a few handmade batches in our home kitchen has grown into a passionate, dog-loving brand trusted by pet parents across India.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">All of our treats are:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
      <li>100% homemade and fresh</li>
      <li>Free from preservatives, artificial colors, and fillers</li>
      <li>Crafted in small batches using locally sourced ingredients</li>
      <li>Approved by our own furry taste testers</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">At Mad for Treats, we believe every dog deserves to be spoiled with love ‚Äî and snacks. Whether you're rewarding good behavior or just saying "I woof you," our treats are the perfect choice.</p>
